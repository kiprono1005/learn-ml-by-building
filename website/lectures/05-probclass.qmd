title: "Lecture 5: Probabilistic Classification"
subtitle: "Logistic Regression & Naive Bayes - When Predictions Can Save Lives"
---

## Overview

In this critical lecture, we tackle a life-or-death classification problem: identifying poisonous mushrooms. Through this compelling case study, you'll discover why probabilistic outputs are essential for risk-aware decisions, moving beyond simple yes/no predictions. We'll build two fundamental probabilistic classifiers—Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes—and learn how to calibrate them for safety-critical applications where the cost of false negatives can be fatal.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will:

- Understand why probabilistic outputs are essential for risk-aware decisions
- Implement logistic regression as a "soft" decision maker that expresses confidence
- Master Naive Bayes as a probabilistic detective gathering and combining evidence
- Calibrate models and tune decision thresholds for safety-critical applications
- Diagnose model disagreements and understand edge cases
- Build production-ready classifiers that prioritize safety over accuracy

## Datasets & Acknowledgments

### UCI Mushroom Dataset
- Source: **[UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/73/mushroom)**
- Size: 8,124 mushrooms with 22 categorical features
- Why This Dataset: Perfect 52/48 class balance, real mushroom characteristics from field guides, and life-or-death stakes make it ideal for teaching safety-critical classification

## Key Takeaways

## Critical Safety Principle
In mushroom classification, it's better to skip a meal than risk your life! This principle extends to all safety-critical applications where false negatives have catastrophic consequences.
