title: "Project 1: Music Recommendation System with k-NN"
subtitle: "From Algorithm Implementation to Web Deployment"
---

## Overview

Build a **Spotify-inspired music recommendation engine** from scratch, implementing the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm and deploying it as an interactive web application. This project bridges the gap between academic ML and real-world applications, taking you through the complete pipeline from data exploration to production deployment. You'll work with actual Spotify audio features to recommend songs based on musical similarity.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- **Implement** k-NN from scratch with multiple distance metrics (Euclidean, Cosine)
- **Analyze** Spotify's audio features (energy, valence, danceability) through exploratory data analysis
- **Engineer** features and apply scaling techniques to handle multi-scale data
- **Design** hybrid distance functions that combine audio features with metadata
- **Evaluate** computational complexity and scalability challenges
- **Deploy** your ML model as a REST API with a responsive web interface
- **Optimize** with caching strategies for production performance

## What You'll Build

### Core Algorithm
You'll implement k-NN from the ground up, including:
- Distance metric calculations (Euclidean and Cosine)
- Efficient neighbor search
- Feature scaling for fair comparisons
- Hybrid distance functions combining multiple signals

### Web Application
Your algorithm will power a full-stack music discovery application featuring:
- Search for any track in a 600k+ song database
- Real-time recommendations based on audio similarity
- YouTube integration for music previews
- Interactive controls for algorithm parameters
- Mobile-responsive design

### Data Analysis
Working with real Spotify data, you'll explore:
- 9 audio features extracted by Spotify's ML models
- Feature distributions, correlations, and outliers
- The impact of scaling on distance-based algorithms
- Trade-offs between different similarity measures

## Key Technologies

- **Backend**: Flask, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **APIs**: YouTube Data API for music previews
- **Data**: 600k+ tracks with Spotify audio analysis

## Interactive Features

:::{.callout-note}
## üéµ Try It Yourself
Once deployed, your system will let users:

- Search and discover music from over half a million tracks
- Get personalized recommendations based on any song
- Adjust algorithm parameters (k, distance metrics) in real-time
- Listen to preview clips before adding to playlists
- Understand why songs were recommended through feature visualization

## Setup Guide

```bash
# Quick setup
python3.11 -m venv .venv-music
source .venv-music/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure YouTube API (see notebook for detailed instructions)
echo "YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_key_here" > .env

# Run the application
python app.py
# Navigate to http://localhost:5002
```

## Data Setup

Place the dataset CSV(s) in the project‚Äôs `data/` folder:

- Required: `data/mergedFile.csv` ‚Äî main catalog with track metadata and audio features
- Optional: `data/item_profile.csv` ‚Äî alternative profile file if you choose to separate it

Notes:

- Column expectations include song/artist identifiers and audio features (e.g., energy, danceability, etc.).
- The application won‚Äôt function without `mergedFile.csv`. See repository README for more details and dataset link.

## Real-World Challenges You'll Tackle

1. **The Curse of Dimensionality**: Understand why distance metrics behave unexpectedly in high dimensions
2. **Feature Scale Bias**: See how tempo (0-200 BPM) can dominate valence (0-1) without proper scaling
3. **Computational Complexity**: Analyze why brute-force k-NN doesn't scale to millions of songs
4. **Production Engineering**: Implement caching and API design for responsive user experience
5. **Hybrid Metrics**: Balance audio similarity with artist diversity for better recommendations

## Project Insights

This project demonstrates several key ML concepts:

- **Instance-based learning** requires no training phase but trades computation at query time
- **Feature engineering** can be more important than algorithm choice
- **Distance metrics** encode our notion of similarity - choosing the right one is crucial
- **Production ML** involves much more than just the algorithm - APIs, caching, and UX matter
