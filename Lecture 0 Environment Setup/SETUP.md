# Quick Environment Setup Guide

## Prerequisites
- Computer with admin access
- 5GB free disk space  
- Internet connection

## Step 1: Install Python 3.9.6

### Windows
1. Download Python 3.9.6 from: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-396/
   - Choose "Windows installer (64-bit)"
2. Run installer
   - **CHECK** "Add Python 3.9 to PATH" 
   - Click "Install Now"
3. Verify in Command Prompt:
   ```cmd
   python --version
   ```
   Should show: `Python 3.9.6`

### macOS
1. Download Python 3.9.6 from: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-396/
   - Choose "macOS 64-bit universal2 installer"
2. Run the .pkg installer
3. Verify in Terminal:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```
   Should show: `Python 3.9.6`

### Linux
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3.9 python3.9-venv python3-pip

# Verify
python3.9 --version
```

## Step 2: Create Virtual Environment

Open Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows) and navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd path/to/learn-ml-by-building
```

### Windows
```cmd
py -3.9 -m venv ml_lectures_env
ml_lectures_env\Scripts\activate
```

### macOS/Linux
```bash
python3.9 -m venv ml_lectures_env    # or: python3 -m venv ml_lectures_env
source ml_lectures_env/bin/activate
```

You should see `(ml_lectures_env)` in your terminal prompt.

## Step 3: Install Required Packages

With virtual environment activated:

```bash
# Upgrade pip first (use interpreter-scoped pip)
python -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Install all requirements (repo root requirements.txt at /Users/ming/Dropbox/learn-ml-by-building/requirements.txt)
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

  Note: On macOS/Linux you may prefer `python3 -m pip ...`; both are fine when the environment is activated.
  
  This will take 5-15 minutes and download several hundred MB of packages. The requirements include deep learning dependencies `torch==2.2.2` and `torchvision==0.17.2`.

## Step 4: Launch Jupyter Notebook

Still in the activated virtual environment:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open your browser. Navigate to `00-Environment-Setup.ipynb` and open it.

### RISE slides and interactive widgets
- RISE is installed and enabled. In the classic Notebook toolbar, look for the "Enter/Exit RISE Slideshow" button.
- ipywidgets is installed and enabled. Test with a quick cell:
  
```python
import ipywidgets as widgets
widgets.IntSlider(description="Test")
```

If the RISE button is missing or widgets don't render, make sure you launched Jupyter from the activated environment so it uses the correct interpreter.

### Optional: Register this environment as a Jupyter kernel
This lets you pick the kernel by name inside Jupyter.

```bash
python -m ipykernel install --user --name ml_lectures_env --display-name "Python (ml_lectures_env)"
```

## Troubleshooting

### "python not recognized" (Windows)
- Reinstall Python and ensure "Add to PATH" is checked
- Or use `py -3.9` instead of `python`

### "jupyter: command not found"
- Make sure virtual environment is activated (you see `(ml_lectures_env)`)
- Reinstall with interpreter-scoped pip: `python -m pip install jupyter notebook`

### "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'torch'"
- Ensure you've installed the repo requirements: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Or install directly: `python -m pip install torch torchvision`
- Restart the Notebook kernel after installation (Kernel â†’ Restart Kernel) and re-run your cells.

### Permission errors
- Avoid using `sudo` with pip. Ensure your virtual environment is activated and try again.
- Windows: Run Command Prompt as Administrator if needed for system operations.

### Virtual environment not activating
- Windows PowerShell: `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser`
- Mac/Linux: `chmod +x ml_lectures_env/bin/activate`

## Daily Workflow

Every time you work on the course:

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd path/to/learn-ml-by-building

# 2. Activate environment
source ml_lectures_env/bin/activate     # Mac/Linux
ml_lectures_env\Scripts\activate       # Windows

# 3. Start Jupyter
jupyter notebook

# 4. When done, deactivate
deactivate
```

**Once Jupyter opens, continue with the `00-Environment-Setup.ipynb` notebook!**
